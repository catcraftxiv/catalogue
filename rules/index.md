Rules is very simple :> in short, feel free to edit our <a href="https://www.xivmodarchive.com/user/111283" target="_blank">free</a> mods, but do **not** sell our work and edits of it please!

I can't include every single case into cool-looking list, so please if you not sure use common sense or just ask me at discord :>

## if you making something for personal use:
- edit any mod for personal use as you wish

## if you about to post your edit *anywhere*:
- any edits of <a href="https://www.xivmodarchive.com/user/111283" target="_blank">free</a> releases is okay as long as **your mod free**
- **link** original mod
- do not use our stuff for your **paid** mods
- do not use our **paid** stuff for your mods
- do not port in other games
